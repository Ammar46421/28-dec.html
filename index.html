            <h3>Early Education</h3>
            <br>
            In 1954, he completed his foundational education in the primary school of his ancestral village that had been established in 1942 by his great-grandfather, Faqīr Mawlā Bakhsh Shar. Alongside this, he studied the Quran with Hafiz Qādir Bakhsh who had been appointed by his father to teach Quran to the children of the village.[2]

           <h3>Joining Jamiah Rashidia</h3> 
        </p> 
           <br>
            In 1957, he enrolled into the distinguished seminary of South Asia, Jamia Rashidia Dargah Sharif, Pir Jo Goth. Under the tutelage of accomplished ulema, he diligently advanced through the disciplines of Islamic scholarship until completing his scholarly training with the study of the canonical works of hadith (dawrat al-hadith). Besides this, he also displayed great respect towards his teachers, served them, and took blessings from the dargah.[3]
            <br>
            <h3>Honourable teachers</h3>
            <br>
            The distinguished teachers and ulema of Jamia Rashidia who he studied under include Mufti Muhammad Sāḥibdād Jamālī, Mawlana Muhammad Sāliḥ Mehr, Mufti Taqaddus ꜤAli Khān, Sayyid Hussain Akhtar, Mawlana ꜤAbd al-Ṣamad Meetlu, and Mawlana Karīm Bakhsh Dāyū  رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْهِم.[4]
            <br>
            <h3>Graduation</h3>
            <br>
            His graduation ceremony took place on Friday, 27 Rajab, 1386 AH/11 November 1966 CE. Eminent scholars, including Pir Muhammad Qāsim Mashwari, Pir Ghulām Mujaddid Sarhandī, Sayyid Aḥmad SaꜤīd Kāẓmī, Muhammad ꜤUmar Icharwī, Mawlana Qāḍī Dost Muhammad, Mawlana Muhammad Husayn Qādirī, and Makhdūm Amīr Aḥmad Kahrāī رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْهِم,[5] attended the event.

            <h3>Founding of Madrassa Sibghat-ul-Huda in Shahpur, Chakar</h3>
            <br>
            In the same year he graduated, upon the instruction of his teacher, Mawlana Muhammad Ṣāliḥ Mehr رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه, he assumed the role of imam and Friday preacher at the Ghawthiyyah Masjid in Shahpur, Chakar, Sindh. In 1967, he founded Madrassa Sibghat-ul-Huda. There, he initiated Quran lessons and foundational classes in Arabic and Persian. After more teachers were appointed, students were given the opportunity to study the entire Dars-i-Nizami syllabus, but Mufti ꜤAbd al-Raḥīm Sikandarī رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه would teach dawrah al-Hadith himself.[6]
            <br>
            <h3>His Legacy</h3>
            <br>
            Just as his teaching produced many scholars for the Ummah, his written works constituted masterpieces too. Below are some of his written works:

            Mufti ꜤAbd al-Raḥīm رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه also founded a library in 1967, which became one of the most respected repositories in the country. Boasting over 100 exegeses of the Quran, it houses all classic and reliable works of hadith, all source texts of sira, thousands of hagiographical and biographical works, and countless books on narrator evaluation, Islamic law, legal theory, religious edicts, tasawwuf, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Sindhi literature, philosophy, lexicons, to name a few. It also contains around 300 rare manuscripts of Quranic commentary, hadith, Islamic law, tasawwuf and history in Arabic, Persian and Sindhi.[8]

            <h3>Mastery in oratory</h3>
            <br>
            Mufti ꜤAbd al-Raḥīm رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه was also recognised as an influential orator, preacher, prophetic devotee and true representative of Ahl al-Sunnah. He promulgated Islam, prophetic devotion, reverence of the Companions and Prophetic Household, and the doctrine of Ahl al-Sunnah throughout many areas of Pakistan. Due to his mastery in oratory, the spiritual guide Āgha Muhammad Ibrāhīm Jān Sarhandi Fārūqī رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه conferred upon him the title Sultan al-Wāi’ẓīn (Chief of Orators).[9]
            <br>
            <h3>Debates</h3>
            <br>
            Five years after graduating, he had a historical debate with an experienced teacher on the knowledge of the unseen (Ꜥilm al-ghayb) and defeated him. His second debate was with an individual who was initially set to debate the erudite scholar Fayz Aḥmad Owaisī رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه, but in the final moments, he sought to excuse himself by stipulating that the debate would take place in Sindhi. Thus, Mufti ꜤAbd al-Rahīm Sikandarī رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه was chosen to debate him instead. Unable to counter the knowledge and swift responses of Mufti ꜤAbd al-Rahīm رَحْمَةُ الـلّٰـهِ عَلَيْه, the man left his books and fled in the early part of the debate.[10]
